<h2>Description</h2> 
A flasked based RESTful API application which is designed to run in a GPU-accelerated (cloud) environment and handle incoming requests for image generation in a queue like order.
The images will be created using a StableDiffusion pipeline and the [PhotoMaker](https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker) adapter.

Will form a good basis for development tools I plan to create which wil call this application for its generation.
