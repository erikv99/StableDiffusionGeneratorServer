<p id="description">
  Flask-based RESTful API for Stable Diffusion Image img2img using the 
  <a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker">PhotoMaker</a> adapter
</p>

<h2>Description</h2> 
A flasked based RESTful API application which is designed to run in a GPU-accelerated (cloud) environment and handle incoming requests for image generation in a queue-like order.
The images will be created using a StableDiffusion pipeline and the 
<a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker">PhotoMaker</a> adapter.

Will form a good basis for development tools I plan to create which will call this application for its generation. 

<h2>Brief rundown</h2>
Will take 1 or multiple images of a person and combine these with a prompt to place said person in a different context.
